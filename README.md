# Cool Dogs Fetcher

A lightweight Flask app that fetches dog images, stores them in a temporary SQLite database, and serves them via a small web UI.

Architecture
- **Flask (Python)** â€“ Web API & UI  
- **SQLite** â€“ Local ephemeral storage (auto-created)  
- **Frontend** â€“ Minimal HTML + JS served at `/`


ðŸ”— Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |

| `/` | GET | Web UI |
| `/image/fetch?x=N` | GET | Fetch N new images (resets DB) |
| `/image/<name>` | GET | Retrieve stored image by name |
| `/image/last` | GET | Retrieve the latest stored image |
